Welcome to Class '95's awesome scheduling service.  [![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/Yamievw/class95?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

Thank you for your patience. 

We have used an iterative approach, a Hill Climber and a Simulated Annealing algorithm, due to the massive state space of this problem. These start from a random but valid initial schedule and through random changes, try to increase the schedule's score. We have also opted to keep tutorial and lab groups the same, to allow for people to work together. Schedules can be visualized in an html table. 

We have used python 2.7 and the following packages:
Pickle, Random, Datetime, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn, Os, Progressbar, Math, Copy, Operator, Networkx, Counter, Numpy, Prettytable en Webbrowser.

A description of the original problem (Dutch) can be found on https://heuristieken.nl.

We hope you enjoy our work.
